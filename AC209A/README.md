# AC209A: Data Science I 

##### -<ins>Course Description</ins>: Data Science I is the first half of a one-year introduction to data science. The course will focus on the analysis of messy, real life data to perform predictions using statistical and machine learning methods. Material covered will integrate the five key facets of an investigation using data: (1) data collection - data wrangling, cleaning, and sampling to get a suitable data set;  (2) data management - accessing data quickly and reliably; (3) exploratory data analysis – generating hypotheses and building intuition; (4) prediction or statistical learning; and (5) communication – summarizing results through visualization, stories, and interpretable summaries. Part one of a two part series. The curriculum for this course builds throughout the academic year. Students are strongly encouraged to enroll in both the fall and spring course within the same academic year.
##### -<ins>Project</ins>: The course project is your opportunity to work with the course instructors and TFs to explore a topic in depth. If you are looking for project partners, we suggest you post on Ed.Projects for 209A teams will be graded at a higher level. These projects must implement a method that was not discussed in class.
