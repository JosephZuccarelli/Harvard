# AC207: Systems Development for Computational Science

##### -<ins>Course Description</ins>: This is a project-based course emphasizing designing, building, testing, maintaining and modifying software for scientific computing and data sciences. The class is focusing on a thorough introduction of the Python programming language with discussion of core concepts in object oriented programming as well as essential data structures useful in most programming tasks. Students will work in groups on a semester long project that combines the subjects discussed in class and applies them to the topic of automatic differentiation. Students will further learn how to work with SQL databases and how to integrate them in Python using SQLite3 and Pandas. After completion of this course, students will be able to adapt basic tools and techniques to design complex software systems aimed at solving computational and data processing problems in academic and industrial environments.
##### -<ins>Project</ins>: You will develop a software library for a client (the teaching staff). The development of this library will leverage modern software development practices covered in the course. By the end of the semester, the client should be able to easily install and run your package. The project topic is automatic differentiation (AD). AD is a very broad area spanning computer science and mathematics with applications in fields across science and engineering. You will work in groups of 3-4 students. The teaching staff will assign you to groups. Some members of the group will be stronger than others. It is expected that you work together and help each other out as needed. This is an opportunity for less experienced coders to drastically improve by working with more experienced coders. On the other hand, the more experienced coders will gain valuable experience in guiding a small development team. Every person must contribute. No single person should dominate the group.
